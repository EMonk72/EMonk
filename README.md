EMonk
=====

This repository will contain all sorts of random C# code that I choose to share, and will eventually form the basis of a library of code using the `EMonk` namespace.

While most of the code here will be my own, I may occasionally include code sourced from other sources with appropriate licensing.  Full attribution, source links and licences (where available) will be provided in these cases.  Please read the header comments and any included Licence files before using these codes.

Feedback is always welcome.  Especially positive feedback.  I *love* positive feedback :grin:
